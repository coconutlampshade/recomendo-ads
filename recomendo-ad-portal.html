<task>
You are a senior UX copywriter and web designer using vibe coding inside Claude Code to create a  “Advertise with Recomendo” site for Recomendo.com, modeled on the Dense Discovery advertising page (https://www.densediscovery.com/advertise/) but tailored to Recomendo’s audience, metrics, and ad products.
</task>

<context>
- Recomendo is a long-running, human-written weekly newsletter that shares six short, personal recommendations in each issue.[1]
- The newsletter has over 120,000 subscribers and consistently high engagement; readers trust the editors and often act on their suggestions.[2][1]
- Dense Discovery’s advertising page is a reference for tone, layout, and structure: a calm, design-forward page that clearly explains audience, ad formats, pricing, availability, and terms in a friendly, transparent voice.[3]
- Recomendo’s audience skews toward curious, tech-comfortable readers interested in tools, apps, books, media, and life-improvement hacks, similar in spirit to DD but with its own distinct personality and editorial voice.[1][4]
- Recomendo currently sells sponsorships and smaller “unclassified” footer ads, with performance-focused case study quotes highlighting strong CPC and subscriber acquisition performance for advertisers.[5]
- The page will live at a URL like recomendo.com/advertise (or equivalent) and should feel cohesive with the existing Recomendo brand and Substack presence.[1]
- The goal of the page is to:
  - Convince relevant brands/newsletters/tools to sponsor Recomendo.
  - Make it easy to understand the offer (audience, formats, pricing, performance).
  - Provide a clear contact or booking mechanism (email or form).
</context>

<constraints>
- Overall vibe:
  - Match a calm, confident, no-hype tone; friendly but **professional**, similar to Dense Discovery’s ad page.
  - Prioritize clarity, transparency, and credibility over persuasion tricks.
  - Use short paragraphs and clear subheadings; scannable and mobile-friendly.
- Content requirements:
  - Hero section:
    - Clear headline that states the opportunity (e.g., “Reach highly engaged readers via Recomendo”).
    - One short supporting paragraph describing Recomendo and its audience.
    - One primary call to action (e.g., “Request availability & rates”) with an email mailto link placeholder.
  - “Why sponsor Recomendo?” section:
    - Bullet list of 3–6 points describing:
      - Audience quality and trust.
      - Strong engagement / click performance (use qualitative claims, no fake numbers).
      - Good fit for tools, newsletters, apps, and other high-consideration products.
  - Audience snapshot section:
    - Bulleted or lightly formatted stats with placeholders where exact numbers can be filled in later (e.g., “[SUBSCRIBER_COUNT]+ subscribers”, “[AVG_OPEN_RATE]% average open rate”, “[COUNTRIES] top regions”). Do not invent exact stats; use clear placeholders.
  - Ad formats section:
    - Describe at least two ad products:
      - Main sponsorship: top-of-newsletter feature (title, description, example structure, and what the advertiser provides vs. what Recomendo writes).
      - Classified / footer ad: short text-only ad with character limit and single link, mentioning that it appears near the end of the issue, similar to DD classifieds.[3][5]
    - For each, include:
      - Where it appears in the newsletter.
      - Approximate word/character length.
      - Who writes the copy (Recomendo vs advertiser) and whether editing is included.
  - Social proof section:
    - Include 2–3 testimonial blocks with generic but plausible placeholder quotes modeled on the style of current Recomendo advertiser reviews (performance-focused, mentioning CPC and subscriber quality, but with [PLACEHOLDER] where specific numbers would go).[5]
    - Each should have a placeholder for company name and role (e.g., “Growth marketer at [COMPANY_NAME]”).
  - Pricing & availability:
    - Explain that pricing depends on issue date and demand; use placeholders like “[SPONSOR_RATE] per issue” and “[CLASSIFIED_RATE] per classified”.
    - Emphasize that inventory is limited and often books weeks in advance.
    - Invite readers to email for current availability and a media kit.
  - Fit & guidelines:
    - Brief section outlining who is a good fit (e.g., tools, newsletters, education, productivity, creative software) and what Recomendo will not accept (e.g., scams, misleading financial products, crypto, surveillance-y adtech, etc.).
    - Stress that all sponsors must align with Recomendo’s values and be genuinely useful to readers.[4]
  - Contact / booking:
    - Clear call to action with:
      - Email address placeholder like “[AD_SALES_EMAIL]”.
      - Simple checklist of what to include in the email (company, product, URL, ideal timing, preferred format).
- Copy & structure constraints:
  - Write all copy as final production-ready text, with clear section headings.
  - Use strictly neutral placeholders in ALL brackets that the user can later replace, e.g., [SUBSCRIBER_COUNT], [AVG_OPEN_RATE], [AD_SALES_EMAIL], [SPONSOR_RATE], [CLASSIFIED_RATE], [TOP_COUNTRIES], [TESTIMONIAL_1_COMPANY], etc.
  - Do not fabricate numeric performance metrics; when referencing performance, use qualitative phrasing (e.g., “strong CPCs” or “well below typical newsletter averages”) plus placeholders for actual numbers.
  - Avoid jargon like “funnels” and “synergies”; use straightforward language.
  - Do not include any implementation code (no HTML/CSS/JS) in the main draft; focus purely on copy and content structure.
- Technical constraints for vibe coding:
  - Organize the answer into clearly labeled sections that map 1:1 to page blocks, in the order they should appear on the page.
  - Within each section, separate “heading” vs “body” vs “bullets” so it is trivial to translate into a layout system.
  - Make it easy to tweak later; no hidden assumptions, no references to external styles.
  — We allow 1 Premium Sponsorship and 10 Unclassifieds in each issue.
